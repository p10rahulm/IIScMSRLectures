<b>Abstract:</b>
In this talk, I will discuss our work on single-timescale actor–critic methods, improving the sample complexity for finding an $\varepsilon$-close global optimal policy from $O(\varepsilon^{-4})$ to the optimal $O(\varepsilon^{-2})$ using STOchastic Recursive Momentum (STORM).
<br><br>
In the second part, I will present our work on robust reinforcement learning, with applications in high-stakes domains such as robotics and healthcare. We introduce a novel value-regularizer and, for the first time, develop an efficient algorithm for a class of non-rectangular uncertainty sets, which are NP-hard in general.
