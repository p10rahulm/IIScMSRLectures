<b>Abstract:</b>
Entanglement is a quantum resource, in some ways analogous to randomness in classical computation. 
Inspired by recent work of Gheorghiu and Hoban, we define the notion of "pseudoentanglement'', 
a property exhibited by ensembles of efficiently constructible quantum states which are 
indistinguishable from quantum states with maximal entanglement. Our construction relies 
on the notion of quantum pseudorandom states -- first defined by Ji, Liu and Song -- which 
are efficiently constructible states indistinguishable from (maximally entangled) Haar-random 
states. Specifically, we give a construction of pseudoentangled states with entanglement 
entropy arbitrarily close to logn across every cut, a tight bound providing an exponential 
separation between computational vs information theoretic quantum pseudorandomness. We discuss 
applications of this result to Matrix Product State testing, entanglement distillation, and the 
complexity of the AdS/CFT correspondence.
