<b>Abstract:</b>
We study the problem of testing whether a function $f: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$ is a polynomial of degree at most $d$ in
the distribution-free testing model. Here, the distance between functions is measured with respect to an
unknown distribution $\mathcal{D}$ over $\mathbb{R}^n$ from which we can draw samples. In contrast to previous work,
we do not assume that $\mathcal{D}$ has finite support.
<br><br>
We design a tester that given query access to $f$, and sample access to $\mathcal{D}$, makes
$\texttt{poly}(d/\varepsilon)$ many queries to $f$, accepts with probability $1$ if $f$ is a polynomial of degree $d$,
and rejects with probability at least $\frac{2}{3}$ if every degree-$d$ polynomial $P$ disagrees with $f$ on a
set of mass at least $\varepsilon$ with respect to $\mathcal{D}$.
<br><br>
Our result also holds under mild assumptions when we receive only a polynomial number of bits of precision for each
query to $f$, or when $f$ can only be queried on rational points representable using a logarithmic number of bits.
Along the way, we prove a new stability theorem for multivariate polynomials that may be of independent interest.
