<b>Abstract:</b>
We consider the problem of fair division, where a set of indivisible goods should be distributed fairly among a set of agents with combinatorial valuations. Broadly, there are two categories of fairness notions in the literature: envy-based fairness and share-based fairness. A fairness notion is universally feasible if it admits a fair allocation for every profile of monotone valuations. While some well-studied envy-based notions (such as EF1) are universally feasible, no known non-trivial share based notion (and no constant approximation of any of them) is feasible for all monotone valuations.
<br><br>
We propose a novel share notion, the quantile share, where an agent assesses the fairness of a bundle by comparing its value to the value of a random allocation. Our main result establishes a strong connection between the feasibility of quantile shares and the classical Erd≈ës Matching Conjecture. Specifically, we show that if a version of this conjecture is true, then the 1/2e-quantile share is universally feasible. Furthermore, we provide unconditional feasibility results for additive, unit-demand and matroid-rank valuations for constant values of the quantile. Finally, we discuss the implications of our results for other share notions.
