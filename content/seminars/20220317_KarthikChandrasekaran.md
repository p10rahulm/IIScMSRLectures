<b>Abstract:</b> In submodular k-partitioning problems, the input is a submodular set function (given via an evaluation
oracle) along with a fixed positive integer k (e.g., k = 2, 3, 4, …) and the goal is to partition the ground set into k
non-empty parts in order to minimize certain natural objectives of interest. Submodular k-partitioning generalizes
partitioning problems over several interesting structures including graphs and hypergraphs. The case of 2-partitioning
corresponds to the classic and well-studied submodular minimization problem which is polynomial-time solvable. In this
talk, I will survey some recent progress towards polynomial-time solvability of submodular k-partitioning for fixed
constants k>=3. As a main technical result, I will present a random contraction algorithm for min-cut in hypergraphs –
this is a generalization of Karger’s algorithm for min-cut in graphs.
