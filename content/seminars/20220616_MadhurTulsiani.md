<b>Abstract:</b> We will discuss some new notions of hypergraph expansion, which can be exploited by spectral
algorithms, as well as ones based on semidefinite programming hierarchies. These properties lead to new structural
characterizations and algorithmic regularity lemmas for hypergraphs, as well as new decoding algorithms  for codes
based on bias-reduction via direct-sum, such as the breakthrough construction of epsilon-balanced codes by Ta-Shma.
