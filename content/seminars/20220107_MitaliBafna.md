<b>Abstract:</b>
The Unique Games Conjecture (UGC) is a central open question in computational complexity and algorithms. In short, the
UGC stipulates that distinguishing between almost satisfiable and highly unsatisfiable instances of a certain 2-variable
constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) called Unique Games is NP-hard. We build algorithms for UG on a large class of
restricted instances called certifiable small-set expanders. In doing so we give new tools to analyze Sum-of-Squares
SDPs and connect the UGC to another important complexity theoretic conjecture, the Small-Set-Expansion Hypothesis.
The talk will start from a basic introduction to the UG problem and will not assume prior knowledge about UG or
sum-of-squares algorithms.
