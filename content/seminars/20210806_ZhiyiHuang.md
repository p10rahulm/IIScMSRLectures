<b>Abstract:</b> Originated from the seminal work by Karp, Vazirani, and Vazirani
(1990), online matching has been established as one of the most
fundamental topics in the literature of online algorithms.
<br><br>
This is the first of two talks that presents the basics of online matching, and surveys the recent
progress in two directions. Today's talk will be focussing on General arrival models and
for the next talk, we will look at some Open problems in online advertising.

<b>General arrival models</b>
<br><br>

Traditional online matching models consider
bipartite graphs and assume knowing one side of the bipartite graph
upfront. The matching problems in many modern scenarios, however, do
not fit into the traditional models. In the problem of matching
ride-sharing requests, for instance, the graph is not bipartite in
general, and all vertices arrive online. There has been much progress
in the past three years on online matching models beyond the
traditional ones, including the fully online model, the general vertex
arrival model, and the edge arrival model.
