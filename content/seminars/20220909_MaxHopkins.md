<b>Abstract:</b>
Expander graphs are a classical tool in theoretical computer science, with applications ranging from network stability
all the way to the PCP Theorem. In this talk, we overview recent developments in the nascent theory of high dimensional
expansion, a generalization of expanders to hypergraphs and posets, and discuss a recent line of work towards their
application to hardness of approximation.
<br><br>
We focus in particular on two interconnected narratives. First, we’ll cover recently popularized spectral notions of
high dimensional expansion, their relation to powerful tools such as hypercontractivity, and discuss how such
connections could open a new path towards proving Khot’s Unique Games Conjecture. Second, we’ll introduce
lesser-known topological notions of high dimensional expansion and discuss how they lead to explicit lower bounds for
fundamental problems within the Sum-of-Squares semidefinite programming hierarchy, the most powerful known algorithmic
paradigm for combinatorial approximation problems such as unique games.
