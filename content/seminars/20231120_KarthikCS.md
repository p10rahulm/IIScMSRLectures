<b>Abstract:</b>
In the k-Diameter Clustering problem, we are given as input a set of points in a metric space, and the goal is to 
partition the pointset to k parts so as to minimize the maximum diameter across the parts. In the 1980s, a 2 factor 
polynomial time approximation algorithm was proposed for this problem (in all metrics). On the other hand, it was 
shown that approximating the k-Diameter problem to a factor better than 2 in the L-1 and L-infinity metrics, and to a 
factor better than 1.97 in the Euclidean metric is NP-hard. However, all the known hardness results were for the case 
when k (the number of clusters) was linear in the input size. In this talk, I will present some exciting new results 
on the (in)-approximability of the k-Diameter problem when k is a constant (for example k=3).
