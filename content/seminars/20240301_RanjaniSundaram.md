<b>Abstract:</b>
NISQ-era quantum computers suffer from limited qubit capacity, restricted physical connectivity and are susceptible 
to noise due to decoherence and gate operations.  Error-correcting codes used to reduce noise often lead to a blow-up 
in the number of qubits further exacerbating the capacity crisis. In this talk, we discuss a workaround that allows 
large-scale quantum computations to be performed on small quantum computers by distributing the computations over a 
quantum network. The main design issue in this approach is the expensive communication between quantum processors. We 
present several algorithms over various circuit and network models that efficiently distribute quantum circuits while 
minimizing the communication cost incurred due to entanglements. Further, we outline possibilities for efficient 
estimation of ground and excited state Hamiltonians using iterative quantum circuit simulations.
