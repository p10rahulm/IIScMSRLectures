<b>Abstract:</b>
Random Walks on graphs reveal lots of interesting information about
a graph and this information has been used to get a lot of algorithmic
mileage in the classical literature on algorithms. It is perhaps not
surprising that this primitive continues to be relevant even in the big data
era as we deal with larger and larger graphs. In this talk, I will describe
how random walks were put to use by algorithm designers even in the
setting of sublinear time algorithms. The talk will cover how you can
use random walks to gain insights about planar graphs and how you can
use random walks to also obtain insights about expanding graphs and
clusterable graphs. The talk will assume minimal background and it will
attempt to present a standalone narrative which should be of interest to
students and researchers in Spectral Methods.
