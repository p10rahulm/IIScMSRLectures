<b>Abstract:</b> In this talk, we will discuss a novel connection between discrepancy minimization and (quantum)
communication complexity. As an application, we resolve a substantial special case of the Matrix Spencer conjecture.
In particular, we show that for every collection of $n$ $n \times n$ symmetric matrices $A_1 \dots A_n$ with spectral
norm bounded by 1 and Frobenius norm bounded by$n^{1/4}$, there is a signing $x$ such that
$|| \sum x_i A_i|| \leq \sqrt{n}$  We give a polynomial-time algorithm based on partial coloring and
semidefinite programming to find such a sign.

The proof of our main result combines a simple compression scheme for transcripts of repeated (quantum) communication
protocols with quantum state purification, the Holevo bound from quantum information, and tools from sketching and
dimensionality reduction. Our approach also offers a promising avenue to resolve the Matrix Spencer conjecture
completely -- we show it is implied by a natural conjecture in quantum communication complexity.
