<b>Abstract:</b>
We establish novel techniques to analyze algorithms in the smoothed analysis model for online decision making.
In this model, at each step, an adversary chooses the input from distribution with density bounded above by the
uniform distribution. Crucially, these techniques hold for adaptive adversaries that can choose distributions based
on the decisions of the algorithm and the previous realizations of the inputs. Our technique effectively reduces the
setting of adaptive adversaries to the simpler oblivious adversaries. The main application is to show that, in this
model, online learning is as easy as offline learning. That is, we show that the regret against smoothed adversaries
is captured by the offline complexity measure, VC dimension. Furthermore, we design efficient algorithms for online
learning, circumventing impossibility results in the worst case.
