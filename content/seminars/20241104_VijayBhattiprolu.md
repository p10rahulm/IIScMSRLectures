<b>Abstract:</b>
We establish strong inapproximability for finding the sparsest nonzero vector in a real subspace (where sparsity refers 
to the number of nonzero entries). Formally we show that it is NP-Hard (under randomized reductions) to approximate 
the sparsest vector in a subspace within any constant factor. We recover as a corollary state of the art 
inapproximability factors for the shortest vector problem (SVP), a foundational problem in lattice based cryptography. 
Our proof is surprisingly simple, bypassing even the PCP theorem. Our main motivation in this work is the development 
of inapproximability techniques for problems over the reals. Analytic variants of sparsest vector have connections to 
small set expansion, quantum separability and polynomial maximization over convex sets, all of which cause similar 
barriers to inapproximability. The approach we develop could lead to progress on the hardness of some of these problems.
