<b>Abstract:</b>
We propose a linear-time algorithm to compute low-rank Chow decompositions. Our algorithm can decompose concise symmetric 3-tensors in n variables of Chow rank n/3. The algorithm is pencil based, hence it relies on generalized eigenvalue computations. We also develop sub-quadratic time algorithms for higher order Chow decompositions, and Chow decompositions of 3-tensors into products of linear forms which do not lie on the generic orbit. In particular, we obtain a sub-quadratic-time algorithm for decomposing a symmetric 3-tensor into a linear combination of W-tensors. Based on the joint work <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10450" target="_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10450</a> with Alexander Taveira Blomenhofer.
