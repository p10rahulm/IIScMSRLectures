<b>Abstract:</b>
The algorithmic study of market equilibria has been a cornerstone of economics and computation since its inception, with rich theories developed around equilibrium/ stability notions such as <i>Nash</i>, <i>Stackelberg</i>, and *Competitive Equilibria*. In this talk, I explore how these classical concepts extend—or fail to extend—to a new and increasingly central economy: the data economy.
<br><br>
With the increasing integration of AI-ML technologies in the industry, data has emerged as one of the most valuable assets of the 21st century. However, unlike traditional goods, data is *non-rival* — it can be freely duplicated and shared without depletion. This fundamental property challenges standard equilibrium frameworks that assume scarcity (limited supply) and exclusivity (no two agents can simultaneously benefit from a resource).
<br><br>
We introduce a formal model of data markets, explicitly capturing (1) the role of data in improving predictive performance as data buyers’ utility functions, and (2) the implications of data’s non-rival nature for equilibrium concepts. Building on this model, we examine the existence, geometry, and computational aspects of various equilibrium notions, highlighting key parallels and departures from traditional markets.
<br><br>
**The talk will begin with a brief tutorial on equilibrium concepts—no prior background required**—and conclude with open problems and emerging directions for the theory and design of data-markets.
