<b>Abstract:</b>
Cut problems form one of the most fundamental classes of problems in algorithmic graph theory. In
this paper, we initiate the algorithmic study of a high-dimensional cut problem. The problem we
study, namely, Homological Hitting Set (HHS), is defined as follows: Given a nontrivial r-cycle
z in a simplicial complex, find a set S of r-dimensional simplices of minimum cardinality so that S
meets every cycle homologous to z. Our first result is that HHS admits a polynomial-time solution
on triangulations of closed surfaces. Interestingly, the minimal solution is given in terms of the
cocycles of the surface. Next, we provide an example of a 2-complex for which the (unique) minimal
hitting set is not a cocycle. Furthermore, for general complexes, we show that HHS is W[1]-hard
with respect to the solution size p. In contrast, on the positive side, we show that HHS admits an
FPT algorithm with respect to p + d, where d is the maximum degree of the Hasse graph of the
complex K.

I will begin the talk with a gentle introduction to homology and cohomology with Z_2 coefficients
and I won't assume any prior knowledge.

The talk is based on joint work with Ulrich Bauer and Meirav Zehavi.
