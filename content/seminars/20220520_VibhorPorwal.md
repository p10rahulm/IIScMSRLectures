<b>Abstract:</b> A well-studied challenge that arises in the structure learning problem of causal directed acyclic
graphs (DAG) is that using observational data, one can only learn the graph up to a "Markov equivalence class'' (MEC).
The remaining undirected edges have to be oriented using interventions, which can be very expensive to perform in
applications. Thus, the problem of minimizing the number of interventions needed to fully orient the MEC has received
a lot of recent attention. In this talk, I'll describe a new universal lower bound on the number of single-node
interventions that any algorithm (whether active or passive) would need to perform in order to orient a given MEC.
I'll then discuss the tightness of this lower bound and compare it with previously known lower bounds. I'll also
describe the notion of CBSP orderings, which are topological orderings of DAGs without v-structures, and underly the
main technical idea for proving our lower bound.
