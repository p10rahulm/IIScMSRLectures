<b>Abstract:</b>
Fourier growth of a Boolean function refers to the growth of the sum of absolute values of the level-k Fourier
coeï¬€icients. Upper bounds on the Fourier growth, even for the first few levels, have important applications in
pseudorandomness, learning theory, circuit lower bounds and quantum-versus-classical separations. We study the Fourier
growth of functions associated with communication protocols, namely XOR functions. In this setting, Alice gets a
bitstring x and Bob gets a bitstring y, and together they wish to compute a Boolean function that only depends on x+y 
(the point-wise Alice's and Bob's inputs). If a protocol C computes an XOR function, then the output C(x,y) of the
protocol is a function of x + y. This motivates us to study the XOR-fiber H of a communication protocol C defined by 
$H(z) := E[ C(x,y) \mid x + y = z]$.

In this talk, we present improved Fourier growth bounds for the XOR-fibers of randomized communication protocols that
communicate at most d bits. For the first level, we show a tight O(sqrt{d}) bound. For the second level, we show an
improved O(d^{3/2}) bound. We conjecture that the optimal bound is O(d.polylog(n)) and this is an open question. Our
proof relies on viewing the protocol and its Fourier spectrum as a martingale. One crucial ingredient we use to control
the step sizes of the martingale is a spectral notion of k-wise independence. We also provide a way of adaptively
partitioning a large set into a few spectrally k-wise independent sets.
