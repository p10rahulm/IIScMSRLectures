<b>Abstract:</b>
Classical network design models, such as the Survivable Network Design problem (SNDP), are (partly) motivated by 
robustness to faults under the assumption that any subset of edges up to a specific number can fail. SNDP admits a 
2-approximation via the iterated rounding technique of Jain. We consider non-uniform fault models
where the subset of edges that fail can be specified in different ways. We consider two models. The first is the
flexible graph connectivity model that was introduced by Adjiashvili in 2013, and has seen renewed interest
in recent work. The second is the bulk robust model that was considered in a work of Adjiashivili, Sitters and 
Zenklusen in 2015. The approximability of  network design problems in the non-uniform models is much less understood.
The talk will explain the models, the connection between them, and some recent progress on
approximation algorithms.
