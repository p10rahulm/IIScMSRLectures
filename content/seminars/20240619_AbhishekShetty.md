<b>Abstract:</b>
In statistical learning theory, determining the sample complexity of realizable binary classification for VC classes was
a long-standing open problem. The results of Simon and Hanneke established sharp upper bounds in this setting. However,
the reliance of their argument on the uniform convergence principle limits its applicability to more general learning
settings such as multiclass classification and bounded regression, where improved bounds in expectation can be achieved
through exchangeability based arguments.

In this talk, we will discuss a simple technique that addresses this issue. We will present optimal high probability
risk bounds through a framework that surpasses the limitations of uniform convergence arguments by bringing together
exchangeability arguments with techniques from sequential decision making.

No prior knowledge of statistical learning theory will be assumed. This is based on joint work with Ishaq Aden-Ali,
Yeshwanth Cherapanamjeri and Nikita Zhivotovskiy.
