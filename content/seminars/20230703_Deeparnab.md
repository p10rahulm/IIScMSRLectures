<b>Abstract:</b>
Many clustering problems are NP-hard and therefore extensive research has gone into designing approximation algorithms 
for these problems. Indeed, many techniques in approximation algorithms have been honed in the study of many of these 
fundamental problems.  In this talk, I will talk about a technique called the “round-or-cut technique” (also called the 
“cutting plane technique” in integer programming parlance) which is probably not as well-known as many other techniques 
in approximation algorithms. In the last five years, however, this technique has led to tractable approximation 
algorithms for many clustering problems. I would like to present this general technique and illustrate it on one 
such clustering problem.

This talk plans to be self-contained and no assumption of rounding or cutting will be assumed.
