<b>Abstract:</b>
Fairness is a fundamental human endeavor. In times when an increasing amount of decision-making is being handed over 
to automated systems, it is more important than ever to provide solutions with provable, mathematically rigorous 
guarantees. The area of fair division provides a formal theoretical framework to reason about such questions in the 
context of resource allocation.
<br><br>
In this talk, I will focus on fair allocation of indivisible resources, which models real-world settings such as 
inheritance division and course allocation at universities. Traditional approaches towards this problem focus either 
on randomized allocations that are fair in expectation or deterministic allocations that are approximately fair. 
I will discuss an algorithmic framework that unifies randomization and approximation: Specifically, I will present 
an algorithm for finding a randomized allocation of indivisible goods that is ex-ante envy- free and ex-post envy-free 
up to one good. I will also outline some open problems and directions for future work.
