<b>Abstract:</b> The network reconfiguration problem seeks to find a rooted tree T such that the energy of the (unique)
feasible electrical flow over T is minimized. The tree requirement on the support of the flow is motivated by
operational constraints in electricity distribution networks. The bulk of existing results on convex optimization over
vertices of polytopes and on the structure of electrical flows do not easily give guarantees for this problem, while
many heuristic methods have been developed in the power systems community as early as 1989. Our main contribution
is to give the first provable approximation guarantees for the network reconfiguration problem. We provide novel lower
bounds and corresponding approximation factors for various settings ranging from $\min(O(m-n), O(n))$ for general
graphs, to $O(\sqrt{n})$ over grids with uniform resistances on edges, and $O(1)$ for grids with uniform edge resistances
and demands. To obtain the result for general graphs, we propose a new method for (approximate) spectral graph
sparsification, which may be of independent interest. Using insights from our theoretical results, we propose a
general heuristic for the network reconfiguration problem that is orders of magnitude faster than existing methods
in the literature, while obtaining comparable performance.
