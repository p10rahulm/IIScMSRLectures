<b>Abstract:</b>
I will talk about the distributed CONGEST model of computing, a theoretical abstraction of a distributed synchronous message-passing algorithmic framework that is used in modern network analysis. I will talk about a couple of upper and lower-bound techniques. This will be an introductory talk on the basics and recent research directions in this active research area.
