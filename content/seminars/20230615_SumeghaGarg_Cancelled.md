<b>Abstract:</b> 

A recent line of work has shown a surprising connection between multicalibration -- a multi-group fairness notion, and 
omniprediction -- a learning paradigm that provides simultaneous loss minimization guarantees for a large family of 
loss functions [GKR+'22, GHK+'23, GKR'23, GHHK+'23]. Prior work studies omniprediction in the batch setting. In this 
work, we initiate the study of omniprediction in the online adversarial setting. In this talk, I will first give a 
brief introduction to notions of multi-calibration and omniprediction, and then we will see how to achieve these in 
the online setting. I will end the talk with some open problems.
