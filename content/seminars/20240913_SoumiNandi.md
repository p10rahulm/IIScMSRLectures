<b>Abstract:</b>
A k-flat H is said to hit or pierce a set $F \subseteq \mathbb{R}^{d}$ if $F\cap H\neq\emptyset$. A set $\mathcal{T}$ 
of k-flats (k-dimensional affine space) is called a k-transversal of a family $\mathcal{F}$ of subsets of 
$\mathbb{R}^{d}$ if for every $F \in \mathcal{F}$ there exists a k-flat in $\mathcal{T}$ that pierces F. 
We say a family $\mathcal{F}$ has a k-transversal of size m (or, at most m) if there exists a k-transversal 
$\mathcal{T} of \mathcal{F}$ and $|\mathcal{T}| = m$ (or, $|\mathcal{T}| \leq m$). 
In this talk, I will present the necessary and sufficient condition for an infinite collection of axis-parallel boxes 
in $\mathbb{R}^{d}$ to be pierceable by finitely many axis-parallel k-flats, where $0 \leq k < d.$.
