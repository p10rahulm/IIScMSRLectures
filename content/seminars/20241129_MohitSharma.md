<b>Abstract:</b>
In this talk, we will first survey characterizations of Bayes optimal fair classifiers for commonly used 
fairness constraints. These can be typically written down as group-dependent or instance-dependent threshold 
classifiers on the posterior class probability. These characterizations help in investigating fairness-accuracy 
trade-offs and provably recovery from data bias. Finally, we state some advantages and disadvantages of working 
with threshold classifiers in practice. Much of the talk will be a survey of existing results in this area and 
recent work with Amit Deshpande (Microsoft Research India).
