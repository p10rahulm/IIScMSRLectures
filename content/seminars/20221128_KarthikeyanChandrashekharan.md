<b>Abstract:</b>
Submodular functions are fundamental to combinatorial optimization. We consider the problem of approximating symmetric
submodular functions everywhere using hypergraph cut functions. Prior works have shown that symmetric submodular
functions over n-element ground sets cannot be approximated within a (n/8)-factor using a graph cut function and raised
the question of approximating them using hypergraph cut functions. In this talk, I will show that there exist symmetric
submodular functions over n-element ground sets that cannot be approximated within a o(n^{1/3}/log^2 n)-factor using a
hypergraph cut function. On the positive side, I will discuss the approximability of symmetrized concave linear
functions and symmetrized rank functions of uniform matroids and partition matroids using hypergraph cut functions.
