<b>Abstract:</b> In submodular k-partitioning problems, the input is a submodular set function (given via an
evaluation oracle) along with a fixed positive integer k (e.g., k = 2, 3, 4, …) and the goal is to partition
the ground set into k non-empty parts in order to minimize certain natural objectives of interest. Submodular
k-partitioning generalizes partitioning problems over several interesting structures including graphs and hypergraphs.
The case of 2-partitioning corresponds to the classic and well-studied submodular minimization problem which is
polynomial-time solvable. In this talk, I will present a polynomial time algorithm for minmax symmetric submodular
k-partitioning for every fixed k.
