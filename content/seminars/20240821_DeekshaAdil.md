<b>Abstract:</b>
In this talk I will present state-of-the-art algorithms for $\ell_{\infty}$-norm regression. These algorithms involve 
new techniques which combine acceleration algorithms with advanced data structures. These combinations were not 
known before and are quite delicate to handle. I would start with an overview of the acceleration algorithms and the 
data structures, and explain how these can be made to work together.
