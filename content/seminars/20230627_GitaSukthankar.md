<b>Abstract:</b>
Data-driven social informatics unites models derived from social science with data-driven approaches in order to model 
and predict population behavior patterns.  It can be used to advance our understanding of human behavior, guide public 
policy decisions, and improve user experience with social media platforms.  In this talk, I'll describe work done at 
UCF's Intelligent Agents Lab (http://ial.eecs.ucf.edu/) in which we use a combination of agent-based modeling, natural 
language processing, and machine-learning to model human social systems for the DARPA challenge, ASIST (AI for 
Successful Teams). Our aim is to create multi-scale models for large-scale social media platforms, medium scale 
software engineering teams, and small scale human-agent interactions.
