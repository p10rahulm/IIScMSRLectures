<b>Abstract:</b>
Data-driven social informatics unites models derived from social science with data-driven approaches in order to model 
and predict population behavior patterns.  It can be used to advance our understanding of human behavior, guide public 
policy decisions, and improve user experience with social media platforms.  In this talk, I'll describe work done at 
UCF's Intelligent Agents Lab (http://ial.eecs.ucf.edu/) in which we use a combination of agent-based modeling, natural 
language processing, and machine-learning to model human social systems for the DARPA challenge, ASIST (AI for 
Successful Teams). Our aim is to create multi-scale models for large-scale social media platforms, medium scale 
software engineering teams, and small scale human-agent interactions.

Dr. Gita Sukthankar is a Professor in the Computer Science Department at University of Central Florida. Dr. 
Sukthankar received her Ph.D. from the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon and an A.B. in psychology from 
Princeton University. She is a recipient of AFOSR Young Investigator, DARPA CSSG, and NSF CAREER awards, as well 
as numerous UCF awards for research excellence.  Her current research centers on multi-agent systems, computational 
social science, and human-robot interaction. She has served as the general chair and program chair of the 
International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multi-agent Systems (AAMAS) and is an area chair for AAAI 2024.  
She has edited two books (Plan, Activity, and Intent Recognition and Social Interactions in Virtual Worlds) and serves
