<b>Abstract:</b> Originated from the seminal work by Karp, Vazirani, and Vazirani
(1990), online matching has been established as one of the most
fundamental topics in the literature of online algorithms.
<br><br>

This is the second of two talks which presents the basics of online matching.
The first talk focussed on General arrival models and
today's talk will be looking at some Open problems in online advertising.

<b>Open problems in online advertising</b>
<br><br>

AdWords and Display Ads are
generalizations of the online bipartite matching problem by Karp et
al. These problems capture online advertising which generates tens of
billions of US dollars annually. This year, we introduce a new
technique called online correlated selection, and design the first
online algorithms for the general cases of AdWords and Display Ads
outperforming greedy, which has remained the state of the art for more
than 10 years, despite many attempts to find better alternatives.
