<b>Abstract:</b>
In 1961, Gomory and Hu showed the surprising result that minimum cuts between all pairs of vertices in an undirected
graph can be retrieved from only a linear number of (single-pair) minimum cut computations. This has remained the
state-of-the-art for the all-pairs minimum cuts problem for the last 60 years, and takes at least cubic time in the
number of vertices. In this talk, I will give a new algorithm that breaks this longstanding barrier and solves the
all-pairs minimum cuts problem in nearly quadratic time.
