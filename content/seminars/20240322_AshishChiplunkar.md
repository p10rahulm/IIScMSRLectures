<b>Abstract:</b>
The $k$-server problem is a cornerstone problem in online computation in
which requests at points in a metric space are to be served by $k$
mobile servers while minimizing the server movement. The weighted
$k$-server problem is a natural generalization of the $k$-server problem
in which the cost incurred in moving a server is the distance traveled
times the weight of the server. Even after almost three decades since
the seminal work of Fiat and Ricklin (1994) on the weighted $k$-server
problem, the competitive ratio of this problem remains poorly
understood. Even on the simplest class of metric spaces -- the uniform
metric spaces, the best known upper bound on the randomized competitive
ratio is doubly exponential in $k$, while, until recently, the best
known lower bound was only logarithmic in $k$. In this talk, I will
present a significant step towards understanding the randomized
competitive ratio of weighted $k$-server on uniform metrics: a lower
bound that is exponential in $k$. If time permits, I will discuss the
best known randomized algorithm that is actually memoryless in the sense
that it moves servers according to a fixed probability distribution
independent of the history.
