<b>Abstract:</b>
We show that packing axis-aligned unit squares into a simple polygon $P$ is NP-hard, even when $P$ is an orthogonal 
and orthogonally convex polygon with half-integer vertices.
<br><br>
It has been known since the early 80s that packing unit squares into a polygon with holes is NP-hard~[Fowler, Paterson, 
Tanimoto, Inf. Process. Lett., 1981], but the version without holes was conjectured to be in P more than two decades 
ago~[Baur and Fekete, Algorithmica, 2001].
<br><br>
Our construction uses a new way of reducing from \textsc{Planar-3SAT}. Interestingly, our geometric realization of a 
planar formula is non-planar. Vertices become rows and edges become columns, with crossings being allowed. The 
planarity of the graph ensures that the polygon doesn't have holes.
<br><br>
These ideas can also be used to show hardness of some closely related covering and partitioning problems.
