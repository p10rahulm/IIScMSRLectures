<b>Abstract:</b>
In a seminal paper, Kannan and Lovasz (1988) considered a quantity $\mu_{KL}(\Lambda,K)$ which denotes the best 
volume-based lower bound on the covering radius $\mu(\Lambda,K)$ of a convex body K with respect to a lattice 
$\Lambda$. Kannan and Lovasz proved that $\mu(\Lambda,K) \leq n \cdot \mu_{KL}(\Lambda,K)$ and the Subspace 
Flatness Conjecture by Dadush (2012) claims a $O(\log n)$ factor suffices, which would match the lower bound 
from the work of Kannan and Lovasz. We settle this conjecture up to a constant in the exponent by proving that 
$\mu(\Lambda,K) \leq O(\log^{3}(n)) \cdot \mu_{KL} (\Lambda,K)$. Our proof is based on the Reverse Minkowski Theorem 
due to Regev and Stephens-Davidowitz (2017). Following the work of Dadush (2012, 2019), we obtain a 
$(\log n)^{4n}$-time randomized algorithm to solve integer programs in n variables. Another implication of our main 
result is a near-optimal flatness constant of $O(n \log^{4}(n))$.
