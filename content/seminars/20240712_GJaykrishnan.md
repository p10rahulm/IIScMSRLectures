<b>Abstract:</b>
The paper considers non-preemptive scheduling problems on parallel identical machines where machines change their 
status from being available to being unavailable and vice versa along the time horizon. The particular form of 
unavailability we consider is when the starting time of each downtime depends upon the cardinality of the job subset 
processed on that machine since the previous downtime. We consider the problem of minimizing the makespan in such 
scenarios as well as its dual problem where we have a fixed common deadline of 1 and the goal is to minimize the 
number of machines for which there is a feasible schedule. The talk will be about the second variant.

I am an about-to-graduate PhD student from the Technion — Israel Institute of Technology in Combinatorial 
Optimization. My PhD research was on developing Approximation schemes for scheduling and bin packing with 
cardinality constraints and variants of this problem.
