<b>Abstract:</b> We present a randomized algorithm that computes single-source shortest paths (SSSP) in
O(m log^8(n) log W) time when edge weights are integral and can be negative and are >=-W. This essentially resolves
the classic negative-weight SSSP problem. In contrast to all recent developments that rely on sophisticated continuous
optimization methods and dynamic algorithms, our algorithm is simple: it requires only a simple graph decomposition and
elementary combinatorial tools.
