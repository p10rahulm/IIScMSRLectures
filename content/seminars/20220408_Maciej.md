<b>Abstract:</b> The speaker will take us on a wondrous journey through different variants of the Privacy Amplification
problem (with different levels of Eavesdroppers power) and associated with the variants of extractors. We'll start
with a toy version of the problem then discuss a classical DW09 result finally culminating in a grand finale: variant
with corrupted randomness sources and tampered memory from AORSS20 and COA21(order randomized). The main result
includes the latest construction of a two-source non-malleable extractor, which surpasses all known constructions of
non-malleable seedless/seeded extractors. We will only show the general overview of the construction/compiler.
