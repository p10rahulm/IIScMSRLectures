<b>Abstract:</b>
In this talk we will explore interesting new connections between Convex Geometry and Unsupervised Learning.
We present the Random Separating Hyperplane theorem, a new take on the classic Separating Hyperplane theorem. It 
potentially has many applications. In particular, we will discuss how RSH can help in learn Topic models provably.
