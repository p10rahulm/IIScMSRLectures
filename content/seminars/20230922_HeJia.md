<b>Abstract:</b>
We present a polynomial-time algorithm for robustly learning an unknown affine transformation of the standard hypercube 
from samples, an important and well-studied setting for independent component analysis (ICA). Total variation distance 
is the information-theoretically strongest possible notion of distance in our setting and our recovery guarantees in 
this distance are optimal up to the absolute constant factor multiplying the fraction of corruption. Our key innovation 
is a new approach to ICAs (even to outlier-free ICA) that circumvents the difficulties in the classical method of moments 
and instead relies on a new geometric certificate of correctness of an affine transformation. Our algorithm is based on 
a new method that iteratively improves an estimate of the unknown affine transformation whenever the requirements of 
the certificate are not met.
