<b>Abstract:</b>
Decomposing a polygon into simpler pieces is a fundamental problem in computational geometry. In the Convex Cover 
problem, we wish to cover our polygonal environment with convex polygons. This problem has been studied for over 
50 years from the lens of complexity theory as well as approximability.  In this talk, we will look at the first 
constant-factor approximation algorithm for Convex Cover in simple polygons [Browne, Mitchell, Polischuk, 
Kasthurirangan; FoCS 23]. En route, we will describe the first constant-factor approximation algorithm for Hidden 
Set — how many points can you place in a simple polygon so that no two of them see each other?  
<br><br>
We will also briefly consider the problem of converting a covering of a polygon into a partition of a polygon (where 
each piece of the partition is “desirable”) [unpublished]. Finally, we will also touch upon the problem of finding a 
target in an environment that has already been compromised using a mobile robot with imperfect sensing capabilities 
[unpublished].
