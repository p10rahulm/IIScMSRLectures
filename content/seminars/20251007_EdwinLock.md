<b>Abstract:</b>
Substitutes preferences have played a prominent role in market design at least since Kelso and Crawford (1982). I will present work on a new characterisation of substitutes preferences using the Product-Mix Auction bidding languages. (The Product-Mix Auction was originally developed for the Bank of England following the 2007-8 financial crisis. It is currently run weekly and has been used to auction approximately £240 billion in repos.) Using geometric arguments, we prove that any substitutes preference can be decomposed into elementary building blocks. This representation of demand is amenable to algorithmic treatment. For instance, it leads to a combinatorial algorithm for computing competitive equilibria, and to query-based 'learning' algorithms that help elicit agents’ preferences.
