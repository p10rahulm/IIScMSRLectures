<b>Abstract:</b>
We design new polynomial-time algorithms for recovering planted cliques in the semi-random graph model introduced by 
Feige and Kilian. The previous best algorithms for this model succeed if the planted clique has size at least $n^{2/3}$ 
in a graph with $n$ vertices. Our algorithms work for planted-clique sizes approaching $n^{1/2}$ â€” the 
information-theoretic threshold in the semi-random model and a conjectured computational threshold even in the 
easier fully-random model. This result comes close to resolving open questions by Feige and Steinhardt.
