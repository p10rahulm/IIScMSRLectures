<b>Abstract:</b>
Computer science seems to be undergoing a paradigm shift. Much of
earlier research was conducted in the framework of well-understood
formal models. In contrast, some of the hottest trends today shun
formal models and rely on massive data sets and machine learning.
A cannonical example of this change is the shift in AI from logic
programming to deep learning.

I will argue that the correct metaphore for this development is not
paradigm shift, but paradigm expansion. Just as General Relativity
augments Newtonian Mechanics, rather than replace it -- we went to
the moon, after all, using Newtonian Mechanics -- data-driven
computing augments model-driven computing. In the context of
Artificial Intelligence, machine learning and logic correspond to
the two modes of human thinking: fast thinking and slow thinking.

The challenge today is to integrate the model-driven and data-driven
paradigms. I will describe one approach to such an integration --
making logic more quantitative.
