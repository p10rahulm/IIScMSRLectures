<b>Abstract:</b>
In this paper, we study the online shortest path problem in directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) under bandit feedback against an adaptive adversary. Given a DAG $G=(V,E)$ with a source node $v_ùóå$ and a sink node $v_ùóç$, let $X \subseteq \{0,1\}^{|E|}$ denote the set of all paths from $v_ùóå$ to $v_ùóç$. At each round $t$, we select a path $x_t \in X$ and receive bandit feedback on our loss $\langle x_t,y_t \rangle \in [‚àí1,1]$, where $y_t$ is an adversarially chosen loss vector. Our goal is to minimize regret with respect to the best path in hindsight over $T$ rounds. We propose the first computationally efficient algorithm to achieve a near-minimax optimal regret bound of $\tilde{O} (\sqrt{|E|T \log(|X|)})$ with high probability against any adaptive adversary, where $\tilde{O} (\cdot)$ hides logarithmic factors in the number of edges $|E|$.
<br><br>
Our algorithm leverages a novel loss estimator and a centroid-based decomposition in a nontrivial manner to attain this regret bound. As an application, we show that our algorithm for DAGs provides state-of-the-art efficient algorithms for m-sets, extensive-form games, the Colonel Blotto game, shortest walks in directed graphs, hypercubes, and multi-task multi-armed bandits, achieving improved high-probability regret guarantees in all these settings.
