<b>Abstract:</b>
We look at a problem of decomposing a graph into several disjoint subgraphs with strict guarantees of internal density. 
This relates to the rich community structure observed in real-world networks, particularly social networks. 
We present a spectral condition for the existence of a decomposition of a graph into such pieces and present 
algorithms to recover such dense subgraphs efficiently. The results require a structural assumption on the graph 
that relates to triadic closure/transitivity commonly observed in such networks; it is a distribution-free statement. 
Moreover, we present a new, stronger metric for assessing the `goodness' of communities and show that this presents 
several advantages over traditional notions of density; our decomposition outputs subgraphs that satisfy this notion.
