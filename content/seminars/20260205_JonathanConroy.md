<b>Abstract:</b>
Roughly, an edge-weighted graph $G$ has padding parameter $\beta$ if for every $\Delta > 0$, there is a stochastic partition of the vertices $V(G)$ into clusters of diameter at most $\Delta$ such that each ball of radius $\gamma$ belongs to a single cluster with probability at least $1 - \beta \cdot \frac{\gamma}{ \Delta}$.
<br><br>
In this talk, I will show that every $K_r$-minor-free graph has padding parameter $O(\log r)$, resolving a long standing open question. A key technical tool is a new structural result on minor-free graphs — the \emph{buffered cop decomposition} — which is also helpful for a host of other problems in planar and minor-free graphs.
