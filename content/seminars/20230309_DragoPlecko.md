<b>Abstract:</b>
Decision-making systems based on AI and machine learning have
been used throughout a wide range of real-world scenarios, including 
healthcare, law enforcement, education, and finance. It is no
longer far-fetched to envision a future where autonomous systems
will drive entire business decisions and, more broadly, support
large-scale decision-making infrastructure to solve societyâ€™s most
challenging problems. Issues of unfairness and discrimination are
pervasive when decisions are being made by humans, and remain
(or are potentially amplified) when decisions are made using machines 
with little transparency, accountability, and fairness. 
In this paper, we introduce a framework for *causal fairness analysis*
with the intent of filling in this gap, i.e., understanding, modeling,
and possibly solving issues of fairness in decision-making settings.
The main insight of our approach will be to link the quantification
of the disparities present in the observed data with the underlying,
often unobserved, collection of causal mechanisms that generate
the disparity in the first place, a challenge we call the Fundamental
Problem of Causal Fairness Analysis (FPCFA). In order to solve
the FPCFA, we study the problem of decomposing variations
and empirical measures of fairness that attribute such variations
to structural mechanisms and dierent units of the population.
Our eort culminates in the Fairness Map, the first systematic
attempt to organize and explain the relationship between various
criteria found in the literature. Finally, we study which causal
assumptions are minimally needed for performing causal fairness
analysis and propose the Fairness Cookbook, which allows one to
assess the existence of disparate impact and disparate treatment.
