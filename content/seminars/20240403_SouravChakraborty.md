<b>Abstract:</b>
We will present a very simple streaming algorithm on F_0 esimation that also caught the eye of Donald E. Knuth.  
<br><br>
This simple algorithm comes out of the first ever "efficient" streaming algorithm (from PODS 21) for the Klee's Measure problem, which was a big open problem in the world of streaming for many years.
<br><br>
This work is based on joint works with N. V. Vinodchandran, and Kuldeep S. Meel across multiple articles, 
notable the following:
<br>
<ul>
    <li>Estimating the Size of Union of Sets in Streaming Models. PODS 2021</li>
    <li>Estimation of the Size of Union of Delphic Sets: Achieving Independence from Stream Size. PODS 2022</li>
