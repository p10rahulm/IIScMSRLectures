<b>Abstract:</b>
A main objective of Computer Science and Computational Mathematics is to develop methods for solving challenging algorithmic problems. Often this quest encounters  fundamental challenges, like NP-completeness- and resorts to ways  in which these obstructions can be sidestepped, e.g., with  polynomial-time approximation algorithms or methods for special classes with additional properties. This comes at the risk of focusing on proving mostly theoretical theorems, instead of developing methods for actually computing solutions.
<br><br>
In this talk, I will discuss these aspects for a number of NP-hard geometric optimization problems that are quite similar in flavor to the geometric Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), but turn out to be of fundamentally different practical difficulty. These include Minimum-Weight Triangulation (MWT), Minimum-Dilation Triangulation (MDT) and Minimum-Area Polygonalizations (MAP).
<br><br>
In addition, I will also sketch some recent insights into the perspectives
of solving classical optimization problems with methods from quantum computing.
