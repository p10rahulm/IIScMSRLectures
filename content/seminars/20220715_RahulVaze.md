<b>Abstract:</b> Traditional metrics of interest in scheduling literature are flow-time, completion-time, makespan etc.
For modern applications e.g. IoT, smart cars, gaming, etc. information timeliness is essential and one measure that
captures it well is the Age of Information, which counts how stale the information is. In this talk, we will consider
the online scheduling problem of minimizing the Age of Information for the most general system model, and discuss some
initial progress in terms of deriving online algorithms with constant competitive ratios.
