<b>Abstract:</b>
Differential privacy (DP) has been recently introduced to multi-armed bandits to formally 
address the privacy concerns in its associated personalized services to participating users 
(e.g., recommendations). Prior work largely focusses on two trust models of DP – the central 
model, where a central server is responsible for protecting users sensitive data, and the 
(stronger) local model, where information needs to be protected directly on users side. 
However, there remains a fundamental gap in the utility achieved by learning algorithms 
under these two privacy models – the regret suffer in the local model is higher than that 
in the weaker central model.
<br><br>
In this talk, we will focus on a stronger model of trust than the central model, while 
suffering a smaller regret than the local model by considering recently popular shuffle 
and distributed model of privacy. We will demonstrate this privacy-regret trade-off for 
both K-armed bandit problem and linear contextual bandit problem.
