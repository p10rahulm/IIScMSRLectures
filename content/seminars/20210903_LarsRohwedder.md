<b>Abstract:</b> In a recent breakthrough in scheduling, Batra, Garg, and Kumar gave the first constant approximation
algorithm for minimizing the sum of weighted flow times. Wiese and I (STOC'21) managed to improve this large unspecified
constant to $2 + \epsilon$. I will give a very graphic presentation of the algorithmic techniques behind this.
