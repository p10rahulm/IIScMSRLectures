<b>Abstract:</b> At ITCS 2010, Dziembowski, Pietrzak, and Wichs introduced Non-malleable Codes (NMCs) which protect
against tampering of a codeword of a given message into the codeword of a related message. A well-studied model of
tampering is the 2-split-state model where the codeword consists of two independently tamperable states. As with
standard error-correcting codes, it is of great importance to build codes with high rates.
<br><br>
Following a long line of work, Aggarwal and Obremski (FOCS 2020) showed the first constant rate non-malleable code in
the 2âˆ’split state model; however, this constant was a minuscule 10^{-6}! In our work[1], we build a Non-malleable Code
with rate 1/3 (nearly matches the rate 1/2 lower bound for this model). This work will be the focus of my talk!
