<b>Abstract:</b>
In the Discrete Steiner Tree problem (DST), we are given as input two sets of points in a metric space, called
terminals and facilities respectively, and the goal is to find the minimum-cost tree connecting the terminals, by
possibly introducing new points (called Steiner points) from the set of facilities, as nodes in the solution.
It was known that DST is APX hard in the L_1 metric by Trevisan (SICOMP'00) and in the Graph metric
(and consequently, L_infinity metric ) by Chlebík and Chlebíková (TCS'08). It was open to rule out PTAS for
DST in every other popular metric.
<br><br>
In this talk, I will sketch the proof of APX hardness of DST in every $L_p$ metric (in particular the Euclidean metric),
edit metric, and Ulam metric.

The talk is based on joint work with Henry Fleischmann and Surya Teja Gavva.
