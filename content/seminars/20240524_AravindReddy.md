<b>Abstract:</b>

In the Maximum-a-Posteriori (MAP) Inference problem, for any given probability distribution, the goal is to find the 
point in the support of that distribution with the highest probability. Potts models and Determinantal Point Processes 
(DPPs) are probabilistic models that were introduced in the context of statistical physics several decades ago. They 
have been extensively used in several computer science applications like computer vision, recommender systems, and 
document summarization. Exact MAP Inference in these models corresponds to NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems 
and so approximate inference algorithms have been extensively studied. For MAP Inference in Ferromagnetic Potts models, 
we provide a strong justification for the excellent performance of a linear programming relaxation approach by going 
beyond worst-case analysis (appeared in AISTATS 2021). For MAP Inference in Nonsymmetric Determinantal Point Processes, 
we provide the first one-pass streaming and online algorithms (appeared in ICML 2022).

Bio: Aravind Reddy was a postdoc at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard until recently, where he worked on 
Computational Biology. He graduated with a PhD in Computer Science from Northwestern University in 2023, where
he was advised by Professors Konstantin Makarychev and Aravindan Vijayaraghavan within the theory group. Prior to this, 
he graduated from IIT Kanpur in 2018 with a B.Tech in CSE and a minor in Physics. His research interests span a diverse 
array of topics within machine learning, such as Clustering, Graphical Models, and Causal Inference. He has also 
dabbled in the application of deep learning for identifying structural variations in DNA sequences.
