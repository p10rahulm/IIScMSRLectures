<b>Abstract:</b>
A number of combinatorial optimization problems can be modelled as maximizing or minimizing linear objectives over 
some set of constraints. We will discuss problems and approaches when we consider the setting when we replace a 
linear objective with a submodular objective. Submodular set functions arise naturally in a number of applications 
and moreover submodularity often helps unify, generalize, and simplify various results. The goal is to give a brief 
overview of some old and more recent results and the emphasis will be on the power of mathematical programming 
approaches that are enable by continuous extension of submodular functions.
