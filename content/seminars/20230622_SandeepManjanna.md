<b>Abstract:</b> 

Understanding environmental and ecological processes, such as the health of coral reefs, or plankton blooms, or 
oil spills, requires persistent sampling of physical phenomena at spatio-temporal scales. In my research, I propose 
that efficient robotic sampling of a spatial field with regions of high local variance (hotspots) requires adaptive 
non-uniform sampling techniques. In this talk, I present algorithms and strategies to achieve efficient robotic 
sampling and reconstruction of non-uniform spatial fields. Spatial fields commonly occurring in nature consist of 
hotspots exhibiting extreme measurements and much higher spatial variability than the rest of the field, which is 
characterized by continuous, positively skewed, spatially correlated measurements. To collect data for modeling such 
fields, I apply informed path planning: a data collection strategy that computes paths to be traversed by a robot 
while considering resource constraints, such as power availability, and the uncertainty of the resulting model that 
should be minimized. I present informed non-myopic path planning techniques for robotic platforms to efficiently 
collect measurements from a spatio-temporal field and build a model of the underlying physical phenomenon with high 
accuracy. These methods are highly adaptive and run in real-time, which are key features for the methods to run on a 
real robot operating in real-world challenging environments.
