<b>Abstract:</b>
The question of how to fairly divide a collection of indivisible items amongst a set of agents has remained of central 
importance to humanity since antiquity. In this fundamental problem, the agents have varied preferences, and an 
allocator seeks to find a single allocation such that every agent perceives its bundle as fair. This problem arises 
in various applications, ranging from classical examples like the division of inherited estates and international 
borders to modern applications such as assigning seats in college courses and allocating computational resources 
fairly. Recent decades have witnessed significant progress, transforming this problem into a fascinating mathematical 
landscape with surprising results and intriguing new challenges. The broad goal is to devise natural definitions of 
fairness, and then study questions such as: does a fair allocation always exist?; can one be (efficiently) computed?; 
what are the precise limits to the degree of fairness one can guarantee? In this talk, I will focus on selected recent 
papers, highlighting three techniques (Quantiles, Subsidies, and Randomization) we use to extend the study of fair 
allocations to general valuation classes and resolve some conjectures and open problems..
