<b>Abstract:</b> Given an algorithm for a computational problem, a natural question is: Can its time or space efficiency
be improved? We study this question for some natural and/or old algorithms for NP-complete problems.
<br><br>
Specifically, we survey some of the modern techniques to design such improved algorithms, with a focus on the Subset Sum and Bin Packing problems:
<ul>
<li>The algorithm by Schroeppel and Shamir (FOCS'79) solving Subset Sum on instances with n items in $O(2^{n/2})$ time
and $O(2^{n/4})$ space can be improved to an algorithm using the same time and $O(2^{0.249999 n})$ space.

<li>The trivial $O(2^n)$ time and poly(n) space algorithm for Subset Sum can be improved to an $O(2^{0.86n})$ time
poly(n) space algorithm, assuming random read-only access to random bits.
<li>The standard algorithm solving Bin Packing with n items in $O(2^n)$ can be improved to an algorithm running in time
$O((2-\varepsilon_b)^n)$, where n denotes the number of items and $\varepsilon_b$ is a positive number that only depends on the number of
bins $b$ available in the instance.
</ul>
<br>


Two key modern techniques we will discuss are
<ol>
<li>A new method based on anti-concentration of subset sums (along with structural new insights in additive combinatorics)
<li>The representation method by Joux and Howgrave-Graham (EUROCRYPT'10) to navigate through the search space in an improved way,
</ol>

<br>
