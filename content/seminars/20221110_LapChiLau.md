<b>Abstract:</b>
The classical Cheeger's inequality relates the edge conductance $\phi$ of a graph and the second smallest eigenvalue
$\lambda_2$ of the Laplacian matrix. Recently, Olesker-Taylor and Zanetti discovered a Cheeger-type inequality
$\psi^2 / \log |V| \lesssim \lambda_2^* \lesssim \psi$ connecting the vertex expansion $\psi$ of a graph $G=(V,E)$
and the maximum reweighted second smallest eigenvalue $\lambda_2^*$ of the Laplacian matrix.
<br><br>
In this work, we first improve their result to  $\psi^2 / \log d \lesssim \lambda_2^* \lesssim \psi$ where $d$ is the
maximum degree in $G$, which is optimal up to a constant factor. Also, the improved result holds for weighted vertex
expansion, answering an open question by Olesker-Taylor and Zanetti.
Building on this connection,
we then develop a new spectral theory for vertex expansion. We discover that several interesting generalizations of
Cheeger inequalities relating edge conductances and eigenvalues have a close analog in relating vertex expansions and
reweighted eigenvalues. These include an analog of Trevisan's result on bipartiteness, an analog of higher order
Cheeger's inequality, and an analog of improved Cheeger's inequality.

Finally, inspired by this connection, we present negative evidence to the $0/1$-polytope edge expansion conjecture by
Mihail and Vazirani. We construct $0/1$-polytopes whose graphs have very poor vertex expansion. This implies that the
fastest mixing time to the uniform distribution on the vertices of these $0/1$-polytopes is almost linear in the graph
size. This does not provide a counterexample to the conjecture, but this is in contrast with known positive results
which proved poly-logarithmic mixing time to the uniform distribution on the vertices of subclasses of $0/1$-polytopes.
