<b>Abstract:</b>
A function phi: {0,1}^n -> {0,1}^N is called an isometric embedding from the n-dimensional Hamming metric space to the N-dimensional edit metric space if, for all x, y in {0,1}^n, the Hamming distance between x and y is equal to the edit distance between phi(x) and phi(y). The rate of such an embedding is defined as the ratio n/N.
<br><br>
It is well known in the literature how to construct isometric embeddings with a rate of 1/log n. However, achieving even near-isometric embeddings with a positive constant rate has remained elusive until now.
<br><br>
In this talk, we will present an isometric embedding with a rate of 1/8 by discovering connections to synchronization strings, which were studied in the context of insertion-deletion codes (Haeupler-Shahrasbi [JACM'21]).
En route, we also improve the analysis of the construction of synchronization strings that appear in literature. 
<br><br>
As an immediate consequence of our constant rate isometric embedding, we improve known conditional lower bounds for the closest pair problem and the discrete 1-center problem in edit metric and NP-hardness of approximation results for clustering problems and the Steiner tree problem in the edit metric, but now with optimal dependency on the dimension.
<br><br>
At a technical level, we introduce a framework for obtaining high-rate isometric embeddings using a novel object called misaligners. We speculate that, with sufficient computational resources, our framework could potentially yield isometric embeddings with a rate of 1/5.
