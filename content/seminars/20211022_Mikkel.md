<b>Abstract:</b> We will give an introduction to the complexity class 竏コ, which consists of problems that
are polynomial time reducible to deciding whether system of polynomial equations and inequalities with integer
coefficients and many unknowns has a real solution. Many classic problems have recently been shown to be 竏コ-complete,
such as the Art Gallery Problem, the Minimum Convex Cover problem, training neural networks, geometric embeddability
of simplicial complexes, and many variants of 2D packing problems. We will outline some of the techniques used in
these proofs, in particular for the case of the 竏コ-hardness of packing problems.
