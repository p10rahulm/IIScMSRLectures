<b>Abstract:</b>
Border (or approximative) complexity of multivariate polynomials plays an integral role in GCT (Geometric Complexity 
Theory) approach to P!=NP.  De-bordering is the task of proving an upper bound on some non-border complexity measure 
in terms of a border complexity measure, thus getting rid of limits. The de-bordering of matrix multiplication tensors 
by Bini played a pivotal role in the development of efficient matrix multiplication algorithms. Consequently, 
de-bordering finds applications in both establishing computational complexity lower bounds and facilitating algorithm 
design. Currently, very few de-bordering results are known. 
<br><br>
Restricted algebraic circuits, therefore, are a good testing ground for these de-bordering questions. Recently, 
Kumar (ToCT'20)  proved that *any* polynomial f can be approximated arbitrarily well by linear projections of the 
polynomial x_1*...* x_N - 1, a special depth-2 circuit for an exponentially large N. In this talk, we will go 
introduce some more border rank measures, for e.g.,~border Waring rank, border Chow rank. We will discuss the 
recent developments relating to them.
