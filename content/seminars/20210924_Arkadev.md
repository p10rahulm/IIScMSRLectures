<b>Abstract:</b>
How much power does negation or cancellation provide to computation?
 This is a fundamental question in theoretical computer science that
 appears in various parts: in Boolean circuits, Arithmetic circuits and
 also in communication complexity. I will talk about some new connections
 between the latter two fields and their applications to extend two
 classical results from four decades ago:  Valiant (1979) showed that
 monotone arithmetic circuits are exponentially weaker than general
 circuits for computing monotone polynomials. Our first result gives a
 qualitatively more powerful separation by showing an exponential
 separation between general monotone circuits and constant-depth
 multi-linear formulas. Neither such a separation between general
 formulas and monotone circuits, nor a separation between multi-linear
 circuits and monotone circuits were known before. Our result uses the
 recent counter-example to the Log-Approximate-Rank Conjecture in
 communication complexity.

 Jerrum and Snir (1982) also obtained a separation between the powers of
 general circuits and monotone ones via a different polynomial, i.e. the
 spanning tree polynomial (STP), a polynomial that is well known to be in
 VP, using non-multi-linear cancellations of determinantal computation.
 We provide the first extension of this result to show that the STP
 remains `robustly hard' for monotone circuits  in the sense of Hrubes'
 recent notion of epsilon-sensitivity. The latter result is proved via
 formulating a discrepancy method for monotone arithmetic circuits that
 seems independently interesting.

 We will discuss several open problems arising from these results.

 (These are based on joint works with Rajit Datta, Utsab Ghosal and
 Partha Mukhopadhyay).
