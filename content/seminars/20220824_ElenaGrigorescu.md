<b>Abstract:</b>Locally Decodable Codes (LDCs) are error-correcting codes for which individual message symbols can be
quickly recovered despite errors in the codeword. LDCs for Hamming errors have been studied extensively in the past few
decades, where a major goal is to understand the amount of redundancy that is necessary and sufficient to decode from
large amounts of error, with small query complexity.
<br><br>
In this talk I will describe our recent results on LDCs and their variants, when the errors are in the form of
insertions and deletions, rather than classical Hamming errors. Local codes against insertions and deletions are
well-motivated by recent progress on DNA storage technologies. I will conclude with several intriguing open problems.
