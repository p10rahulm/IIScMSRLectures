<b>Abstract:</b>
In a recent result H채upler, Ghaffari, and Zuzic [STOC 2021] showed that
so-called $h$-hop oblivious routing schemes with a polylogarithmic
competitive ratio exist. These can be used to solve packet routing problems almost
optimally, i.e., with only a polylogarithmic loss in routing time
compared to a globally optimal solution.
<br><br>
In this talk we present a different way of constructing $h$-hop oblivious
routing schemes that have a weaker (sub-polynomial) competitive ratio
but which can be constructed very efficiently by a distributed algorithm.
<br><br>
This result has important consequences in the area of distributed
computing: it gives novel CONGEST algorithms for a large class of important optimization
problems, including minimum-spanning tree, $(1+\epsilon)$-min-cut,
$(1+\eps)$-shortest paths. Our algorithms solve these problems in
sub-polynomial rounds on any network, as long as a sub-polynomial-round
distributed algorithm exists for this network.

This is joint work with Bernhard H채upler and Mohsen Ghaffari.
