<b>Abstract:</b>
Matroid-convex (or M-convex) functions, defined by Murota, are functions on size k subsets of a ground set which
satisfy a Steinitz's exchange type inequality. M-convex function minimization can be done by some greedy-type
algorithms. More interestingly, Murota proved a splitting theorem that reduces minimization of sum of two M-convex
functions to minimizing two M-convex functions separately.

An interesting question in algebraic complexity is to understand approximative closure of various classes of
polynomials. We use the above splitting theorem to show that the following class of polynomials is closed under
approximation: det(sum_i A_i x_i) where A_i's are all rank 1 matrices. That is, any polynomial which can be
approximately computed by this model can also be exactly computed by it.
