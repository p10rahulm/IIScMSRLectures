<b>Abstract:</b>
We consider the problem of allocating indivisible goods among $n$ agents in a fair manner. For this problem, one of the
best notions of fairness is *envy-freeness up to any good* (EFX). However, it is not known if EFX allocations always
exist. Hence, several relaxations of EFX allocations have been studied. We propose another relaxation of EFX, called
*epistemic EFX* (EEFX). An allocation is EEFX iff for every agent $i$, it is possible to shuffle the goods of the other
agents such that agent $i$ does not envy any other agent up to any good. We show that EEFX allocations always exist for
additive valuations, and give a polynomial-time algorithm for computing them. We also show how EEFX is related to some
previously-known notions of fairness.
