<b>Abstract:</b>
We study the sample complexity of identifying an approximate equilibrium for two-player zero-sum $n\times 2$ matrix 
games. That is, in a sequence of repeated game plays, how many rounds must the two players play before reaching an 
approximate equilibrium (e.g., Nash)?
We derive instance-dependent bounds that define an ordering over game matrices that captures the intuition that the 
dynamics of some games converge faster than others. Specifically, we consider a stochastic observation model such that 
when the two players choose actions $i$ and $j$, respectively, they both observe each other's played actions and a 
stochastic observation $X_{ij}$ such that $E{ X_{ij}} = A_{ij}$.  To our knowledge, our work is the first case of 
instance-dependent lower bounds on the number of rounds the players must play before reaching an approximate 
equilibrium in the sense that the number of rounds depends on the specific properties of the game matrix $A$ 
as well as the desired accuracy. We also prove a converse statement: there exist player strategies that achieve 
this lower bound.
