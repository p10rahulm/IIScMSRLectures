<b>Abstract:</b> High-dimensional expansion is a generalization of expansion to hypergraphs where the expansion of 
certain random walks are witnessed by local neighborhoods.
<br><br>
This talk is on the topic of constructing natural probability distributions over sparse high-dimensional 
expanders (HDXes).  On one hand, (standard/1-dimensional) sparse expanders are plentiful, since a constant 
degree random graph is an expander with high probability.  On the other hand, most natural random models over 
hypergraphs fail to exhibit 2-dimensional expansion unless the average degree exceeds sqrt(number of vertices).
<br><br>
However, sparse HDXes are known to exist due to algebraic and number theory based construction.  
We describe some progress towards constructing sparse HDXes based on random geometrics graphs on the unit sphere.
