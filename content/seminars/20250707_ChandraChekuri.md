<b>Abstract:</b>
Suppose we are given a set of points in the plane and a collection of
(weighted) disks and we wish to cover the points with a minimum weight
sub-collection of the given disks. This is an instance of geometric set
cover and admits a constant factor approximation via the non-trivial
technique of quasi-uniform sampling of Varadarajan that was refined by
Chan et al; this is in contrast to the logarithmic factor hardness for
general set cover. In this talk we consider generalizations and variants
of set cover where the points are colored/grouped into r sets and each
color $i$ has a requirement $k_i$ --- the goal is to cover at least $k_i$
points from each color $i$. The single color case is already interesting
and is the partial set cover problem. We build on work of Inamdar and
Varadarajan and that of Har-Peled and Jones, bring the lens of
submodularity to bear on these problems, and outline several results and
applications to geometric set cover problems, facility location,
fairness and others.
