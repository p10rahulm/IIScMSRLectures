<b>Abstract:</b>
The Four Color Theorem (4CT) --- which states that every planar map can be colored using 4 colors --- was conjectured 
by Guthrie in 1853 --- and was proved first in 1976 by Appel and Haken. Of course, in these 123 years, there were 
multiple failed attempts, and some of these attempts led to new insights, new equivalent formulations of the 4CT, 
and often to the birth of new research areas/directions (one of which is the study of matchings and perfect 
matchings --- my own field of research).
<br><br>
Even today, 4CT continues to inspire new research directions and areas in Graph Theory as well as in the wider 
field of Combinatorics.
In this talk, I will discuss some of this colorful history of the 4CT, its significance and equivalent formulations.
Anyone who has completed a basic course in Discrete Mathematics, or in Graph Theory, should be able to follow.
Hoping to see many of you there!
