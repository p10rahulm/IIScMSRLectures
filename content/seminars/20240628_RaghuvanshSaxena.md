<b>Abstract:</b> 
Kol and Raz [STOC 2013] showed how to simulate any alternating
two-party communication protocol designed to work over the noiseless
channel, by a protocol that works over a stochastic channel that
corrupts each sent symbol with probability \epsilon>0 independently,
with only a 1+O(\sqrt{\H(\epsilon)}) blowup to the communication. In
particular, this implies that the maximum rate of such interactive
codes approaches 1 as \epsilon goes to 0, as is also the case
for the maximum rate of classical error correcting codes. Over the
past decade, followup works have strengthened and generalized this
result to other noisy channels, stressing on how fast the rate
approaches 1 as \epsilon goes to 0, but retaining the assumption
that the noiseless protocol is alternating.
<br><br>
In this paper we consider the general case, where the noiseless
protocols can have arbitrary orders of speaking. In contrast to
Kol-Raz and to the followup results in this model, we show that the
maximum rate of interactive codes that encode general protocols is
upper bounded by a universal constant strictly smaller than 1. To
put it differently, we show that there is an inherent blowup in
communication when protocols with arbitrary orders of speaking are
faced with any constant fraction of errors \epsilon > 0. We mention
that our result assumes a large alphabet set and resolves the
(non-binary variant) of a conjecture by Haeupler [FOCS 2014].

<b>Speaker Bio:</b> 
Raghuvansh Saxena is a Reader at the School of Technology and Computer Science at the 
Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai. His primary research
interest is communication complexity and its applications to other
areas of theoretical computer science, such as coding theory,
algorithmic game theory, streaming algorithms, and distributed
systems. Other topics he likes to think about are computational
complexity, information theory, and things you can convince him to
think about.

under the amazing supervision of Prof. Gillat Kol and my Bachelor's
degree in Computer Science and Engineering from IIT Delhi.
