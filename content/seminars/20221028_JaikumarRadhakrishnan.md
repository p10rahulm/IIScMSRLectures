<b>Abstract:</b>
We will discuss applications of Shannon entropy to problems in Combinatorics and Computer Science. We will see examples
of inequalities in combinatorics where an informal justification based on considerations of information can be
formalized using the notion of entropy. We will discuss the area of randomized two-party communication complexity
and use entropy to derive lower bounds for the Set Disjointness problem. Finally, we will discuss Von Neumann entropy,
the quantum-mechanical analog of Shannon entropy, and its application in the study of the quantum communication
complexity of the Set Disjointness problem. The talk will be accessible to a general scientific audience; we will
assume no prior familiarity with concepts from computer science, information theory, or quantum mechanics.
